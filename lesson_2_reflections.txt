1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A- A new empty repository is initialised, or an unversioned project is converted to a git repository. 
- We need it to create new version-controlled projects
-The good thing is that git does not require any pre-existing server or admin privileges. You dust have to cd into your project subdirectory and run git init, and you'll have a fully functional git repository.
-When you transform the current directory into a git repository, a .git subdirectory is added to the current directory making it possible to start recording versions of the project. 

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A- Files are modified in the working tree. Selectively stage only those changes you want to be part of your next commit (these go to the staging area). You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores a snapshot permanently to your git directory.
- The value of this is that you get to carefully decide the files you want to be in a commit.
